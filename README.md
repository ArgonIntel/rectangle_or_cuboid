## Task

To make a Python script that will take an input of 2D (A, B, C, and X) or 3D (A, B, C, D and X) coordinates from the file.

Python script should provide the following results:

1. It must check if provided points can be vertices of a **rectangle** or a **cuboid** and if can not then finish execution.

2. If points are vertices of a **rectangle** or **cuboid** it must check if point X is inside that shape.

3. To calculate the length of the diagonal

4. Tell if the shape is **rectange** or **cuboid**

### Example:

**Input:**  
0, 0  
5, 0  
0, 5  
2, 2  

**Output:** X is inside the shape: `True`

**Input:**  
0, 0, 0  
5, 0, 0  
0, 3, 0  
0, 0, 1  
1, 1, 2  

**Output:** X is inside the shape: `False`
